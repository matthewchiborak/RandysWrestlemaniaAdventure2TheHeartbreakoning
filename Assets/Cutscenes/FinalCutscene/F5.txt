1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~What you doing here? I thought you were going after Big Show?
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~He got away. I was so close.
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~Oh well. I'm sure he'll turn up eventually. Then you'll get your chance.
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Yeah you're right. What happened to Trump?
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~I kicked him through the moon.
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Oh. Yeah I thought the moon looked at little weird.
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~Yeah it was super weird. He just grew to like 20 stories tall and just jumped into orbit. I had no idea he could do any of that. Or even how.
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Oh hold on. Let me look it up.
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~Look it up?
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Huh? That's weird. The script just says 'Nanomachines, son'.
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~Oh! You went back and grabbed the script?
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Yeah I've just been sitting here reading it. Gotta know what the Federation is planning if I'm going to achieve my dream of taking them down and avenging my father.
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~Gotcha. Hey look, Randy. You don't need to do this alone. If you ever need a tag partner, just give me a call.
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Thanks Shawn. Together we will find and take down the Federation and avoid this scripted fate.
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~Right. Well glad to see you're okay. I'll see you later.
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Hmm? You don't want to read the script for yourself?
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~I don't need to. Whatever is written in there, we won't let it come true. 
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~Are you sure? I feel like there are some things in here that you should know might happen.
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~I don't need their script. I'll write my own script. My own show. I will give them a show that they've never ever seen before. And you know why?
1~2~5~R~Randy Orton~0.5~0.5~0.5~No. Why's that?
1~2~5~L~Shawn Michaels~1~0~0~Because I can.
